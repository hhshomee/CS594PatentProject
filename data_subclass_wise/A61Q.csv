11530300,"Disclosed is a method of crosslinking protein fibers, including wool fibers, by (i) providing a crosslinking agent including an oxidized sugar mixture having a plurality of different oxidized sugars of different molecular lengths and having at least two aldehyde groups (e.g., oxidized soy flour sugars); and (ii) infiltrating a plurality of non-crosslinked protein fibers with the crosslinking agent under conditions effective to cause protein molecules contained in the non-crosslinked protein fibers to become crosslinked. This method yields a population of crosslinked protein fibers, where the protein molecules of the non-crosslinked protein fibers include amine groups that react with the aldehyde groups of the oxidized sugars to achieve the crosslinking of the protein molecules to yield the crosslinked protein fibers.",Residual soy flour sugars as crosslinkers for enhancing mechanical performance of protein fibers,A61Q
11530301,"The invention relates to a hydrogel product comprising glycosaminoglycan molecules as the swellable polymer, wherein the glycosaminoglycan molecules are covalently crosslinked via crosslinks comprising a spacer group selected from the group consisting of di-, tri-, tetra-, and oligosaccharides.",Carbohydrate crosslinker,A61Q
11530302,"The present invention concerns a method to prepare a filler with a hyaluronic acid, which has improved properties of chemical-physical stability over time and optimal viscosity for cutaneous injection. In particular the method comprises a first step in which the hyaluronic acid is crosslinked, and a subsequent step for the neutralization and hydration of the crosslinked hyaluronic acid.",Method to prepare a filler with a hyaluronic acid base using specific crosslinking agents,A61Q
