The guide wire serves as a support rail over which the dilator and sheath can be advanced into the left atrium. This transseptal system is uniquely forward looking and permits cautious and iterative delivery of the dilator into the fossa ovalis for “tenting” by way of a proximal sheath activator that interacts with the dilator.

A session associated with the one or more applications is suspended on the first device and resumed on the second device.",Automated workflow access based on clinical user role and location,A61B
11231907,"A method of controlling a wearable device, and which includes obtaining, by a camera of the wearable device, an image including at least a partial field of vision of a user; identifying, by a controller of the wearable device, an object appearing in the image obtained by the camera at a first time point; storing information about the identified object in a memory; detecting, via a microphone of the wearable device, a speech of a user using the wearable device at a second time point; identifying, via the controller, a word included in the detected speech of the user corresponds to the object identified in the image; retrieving, via the controller, the information about the object from the memory based on the identified word included in the detected speech; and outputting the retrieved information about the object.",Wearable device and method for providing information in a wearable device,A61B
11232290,"Images are analyzed using sub-sectional component evaluation in order to augment classifier usage. An image of an individual is obtained. The face of the individual is identified, and regions within the face are determined. The individual is evaluated to be within a sub-sectional component of a population based on a demographic or based on an activity. An evaluation of content of the face is performed based on the individual being within a sub-sectional component of a population. The sub-sectional component of a population is used for disambiguating among content types for the content of the face. A Bayesian framework that includes a conditional probability is used to perform the evaluation of the content of the face, and the evaluation is further based on a prior event that occurred.",Image analysis using sub-sectional component evaluation to augment classifier usage,A61B
11232293,"A performance capture system is provided to detect one or more active marker units in a live action scene. Active marker units emanate at least one wavelength of light that is captured by the performance capture system and used to detect the active markers in the scene. The system detects the presence of the light as a light patch in a capture frames and determines if the light patch represents light from an active marker unit. In some implementations, various active markers in a scene may emanate different wavelengths of light. For example, wavelengths of light from multi-emitting active marker units may be changed due to various conditions in the scene.",Active marker device for performance capture,A61B
11232555,"There is provided a computed implemented method of automatically generating an adapted presentation of at least one candidate anomalous object detected from anatomical imaging data of a target individual, comprising: providing anatomical imaging data of the target individual acquired by an anatomical imaging device, analyzing the anatomical imaging data by a detection classifier for detecting at least one candidate anomalous object of the anatomical imaging data and computed associated location thereof, computing, by a presentation parameter classifier, at least one presentation parameter for adapting a presentation of a sub-set of the anatomical imaging data including the at least one candidate anomalous object according to at least the location of the candidate anomalous object, and generating according to the at least one presentation parameter, an adapted presentation of the sub-set of the anatomical imaging data including the at least one candidate anomalous object.",Systems and methods for automated analysis of medical images,A61B
11232556,"A surgical simulator for simulating a surgical scenario comprises a display system, a user interface, and a controller. The controller includes one or more processors coupled to memory that stores instructions that when executed cause the system to perform operations. The operations include generating simulated surgical videos, each representative of the surgical scenario. The operations further include associating simulated ground truth data from the simulation with the simulated surgical videos. The ground truth data corresponds to context information of at least one of a simulated surgical instrument, a simulated anatomical region, a simulated surgical task, or a simulated action. The operations further include annotating features of the simulated surgical videos based, at least in part, on the simulated ground truth data for training a machine learning model.",Surgical simulator providing labeled data,A61B
